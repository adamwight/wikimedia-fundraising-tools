Just a quick little thing to take ISO 3166 country codes and create a usable
php array we can paste into wherever.
Refrained from putting this in donationinterface because I don't want to get
anything like this anywhere near my deploy branch for payments.

Downloaded xml to parse from:
http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/country_codes.htm

Then run the script I... haven't written yet. Or something.
TODO: Update readme doc. Hurr.
