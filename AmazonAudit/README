-- Amazon Auditing Script --

INSTALLATION
The python stomp library must be installed for use. This can be obtained
from http://code.google.com/p/stomppy/. This software was developed originally
on the 3.X series of the library.

CONFIGURATION
The amazon-audit.cfg script is provided as a base template. Although this file
can be modified it is recommended you create a site-local.cfg file and feed
it to the script with the '-c' option.

RUNNING
This script requires one argument which is the number of seconds into the past
to look for lost transactions.
