-- Amazon Auditing Script --

INSTALLATION
The python stomp library must be installed for use. This can be obtained
from http://code.google.com/p/stomppy/. This software was developed originally
on the 3.X series of the library.

CONFIGURATION
The amazon-audit.cfg script is provided as a base template. Although this file
can be modified it is recommended you create a site-local.cfg file and feed
it to the script with the '-c' option.

RUNNING
This script requires two arguments which are:
- the number of seconds into the past to look for lost transactions
- and the number of seconds of grace where we will not look for transactions

So, amazon-audit.py 462000 86400 will search 5 days into the past ignoring any
transaction that occurred within the last 24 hours.
